# React Learning Journal 🧠⚛️

Welcome to my React Learning Repository!

This repository is a personal space where I document and track my day-to-day progress while learning **React.js**. It includes hands-on practice, mini-projects, code snippets, and notes from tutorials or concepts I explore.

### 📌 Purpose

- 📅 Track daily learning progress  
- 💡 Practice and apply new concepts  
- 🔁 Revisit and reinforce past lessons  
- 🛠️ Build small apps and components for practice  

### 🧱 Topics Covered (Work in Progress)

- JSX & Components
- Props & State
- Event Handling
- Conditional Rendering
- Lists & Keys
- Forms
- Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Router
- API Integration
- Project Structure & Best Practices

> ⚠️ This is a **learning repository**, not a production-ready codebase. Expect experimentation and work-in-progress code.

Feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to learn together or suggest improvements!

Happy coding! 🚀
